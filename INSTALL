=== Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3-p0 or later for normal use [*mandatory*]
* GNU Make 3 or later to use adlintized Makefile [optional but recommended]
* Racc 1.4.7 for development [optional]

=== Installation

Setup your Ruby interpreter.
Then, you can install \AdLint by following instruction.

 % gem install adlint
or
 % sudo gem install adlint

=== Evaluation

Tiny sample C language projects are bundled with \AdLint gem.
You can evaluate \AdLint by following instructions.

First, copy \`intro_demo' project into your workspace.  "+adlint+ +--prefix+"
command prints the prefix pathname of the \AdLint installation directory.

 % cp -r `adlint --prefix`/share/demo/intro_demo .

Second, generate configuration files for \AdLint.

 % cd intro_demo
 % adlintize

Following files will be generated.

* [+GNUmakefile+] Automatic analysis Makefile for GNU Make.
* [+adlint_traits.yml+] \AdLint configuration file.
* [+adlint_pinit.h+] Project specific initial header file.
* [+adlint_cinit.h+] Compiler specific initial header file.
* [+adlint_all.sh+] Automatic analysis shell script.
* [+adlint_all.bat+] Automatic analysis mswin bat file.
* [+adlint_files.txt+] List file for sh script and bat file.

Finally, do analysis.

 % make verbose-all
 adlint --verbose -t adlint_traits.yml -o . intro_demo.c
